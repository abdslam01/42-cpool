# my 1337-42-C-Pool [sept - oct 2021]
The “pool” is a 4-week immersion in the coding world. Just like a marathon runner, you will take a deep dive.  
Every day, weekends included during a month, you will be working on IT projects.  
At the same time, you get to know fellow applicants, submit and evaluate projects.  
The “pool” program is like a fresh start.  
An opportunity to start a new and no need to have IT knowledge to start.  
The only prerequisite… is to know how to use a computer.

# CHEAT ALERT
- This repo is just for my self. I made it public so I could access it anywhere.
- always ask your mates, their there for you!

# STRATEGY
Just wait until you impatient mate make an attempt and then get traces from him/her.

Or maybe you're that mate ...
